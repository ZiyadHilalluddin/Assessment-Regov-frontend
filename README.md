This assessment were given from GeGov company to fulfill the requirement before interview

From the 1st requirement given, I use React JS to develop the frontend part which are Registration Interface, Sign-In Interface and Profile Interface
For the 2nd requirement, i use Node JS to develop the backend part which is using API for login and register. 

I choose Node JS because i've never experience using it. Before this i only use Python as my backend develop. This is why i challenge myself to use something different. 
Same goes to React JS, It was my first time

There are some Validation and ErrorHandling login and register

The system is simple using gradient colour of card profile from mbd templates and apply to other interface which is Login and Register: https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/profiles/

# Quick Start

## Backend 
npm start
- use nodemon tools
- this start the server that connected to MYSQL, it a good tools for Node.js automatically restarting the server whenever a file changes. 
- It is particularly useful when working on server-side code that connects to a database because it eliminates the need to manually restart the server each time make changes to code. 

## Frontend 
npm start
- view localhost on: 'http://localhost:3000'
